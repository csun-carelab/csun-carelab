# Overview

Welcome to the CARE Lab at California State University, Northridge! We develop mechanisms, interfaces, and learning algorithms to create seamless **human and robot interactions**. Our goal is to enable robots to understand humans, learn from them, and assist them in their daily lives. Our research is, by nature, interdisciplinary --- combining principles from *mechanical design*, *control theory*, and *machine learning*.

We explore several aspects of human-robot interaction. Broadly, our research can be catergorized into three thrusts:
*mechanism design* (shown on left), *robot learning*, *human modeling*.
